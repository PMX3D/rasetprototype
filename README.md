There are currently 5 html pages. You are allowed to edit this site for updates and technical issues. If you discover someting unusual or have an idea for a new feature you'd like to add, begin by submitting that issue. Please do not simply submit a pull request containing the fix or new feature without making an issue first, we will probably not be able to accept it. All .css & .js files are in assets folder. Also, styles.css is a single stylesheet for Home, Sponsorships and Contact us pages. Also, there are some extra media query css files for responsiveness. I've used Javascript just to fulfil some basic requirements of canvas, scroll reveal , mobile menu etc etc .
